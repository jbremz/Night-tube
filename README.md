# Night-tube

## A study of the effects of London's night tube on the night time economy.

Launched 19th August 2016, the night tube was promised to improve the night time economy by [increasing investment and boosting jobs](http://www.cityam.com/247355/londons-night-time-economy-could-worth-30bn-and-extra-70000).

This project looks at government night time economy data and analyses whether we've seen an increase in employment in the vicinity of stations on the Central and Victoria lines.
