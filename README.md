# Night-tube

## A study of the effects of London's night tube on the night time economy.

Launched on 19th August 2016, the night tube was promised to improve London's night time economy by [increasing investment and boosting jobs](http://www.cityam.com/247355/londons-night-time-economy-could-worth-30bn-and-extra-70000). A year after it opened, [research from EY](https://www.london.gov.uk/press-releases/mayoral/night-tube-boosts-londons-economy-by-171m) suggested that it had already surpassed these expectations.

This project looks at government night time economy data and analyses whether we've seen an increase in employment in the vicinity of stations on the Central and Victoria lines - the first lines to offer a 24hr service on Fridays and Saturdays.
